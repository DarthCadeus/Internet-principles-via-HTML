    <h1>Extranets</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>An intranet can be partially accessed by authorized outside users, enabling businesses to exchange information over the Internet securely.</p>
    <h2>What is the importance of extranet?</h2>
    <p>An extranet enables you to collaborate and communicate more with your partners through the web. Also, the extranet can play an important role in improving, for example, business relationships and supply chain management.</p>
    <h2>Differences between intranets and extranets:</h2>
    <p>1.Intranets are easier to secure than Extranets.
        2.Intranets do not usually go through the Internet while typical extranets do.
        3.Intranet users have more access to resources than extranet users.
        4.An Intranet is usually owned by a single group while an Extranet extends to users outside the group.
    </p>
    <h2>Pros & cons of the Extranet:</h2>
    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <p>1.Improved flexibility. Because of trends in innovation and technology advancements, businesses are embracing electronic forms of transactions and communication. Extranets can help boost the level of convenience by which you conduct these exchanges because they offer an efficient way for organizations to connect with affiliates. Since extranets are usually accessible 24 hours per day and there is relatively no downtime.
        2.Increased efficiency.  Because you grant direct access to information on your network to associates of your choosing, the use of extranets can improve efficiency and increase productivity. For example, a customer can get answers to questions regarding your policy information without having to wait for a response from your customer service staff. When used to provide access to internal applications, direct access to your business information via your extranet enables users to change and update their personal information, which not only increases productivity but helps to reduce errors.
    </p>
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <p>1.	Security. Extranets can open your systems up to breaches in system security because you grant outsiders access to your system and internal databases. To grant access to external associates, you must create openings in your firewalls. Multiple openings in your firewalls create higher risks for unauthorized entries.
        2.	Expense. It can be costly to implement an extranet as you may have to foot the cost of hardware, software, manpower and any other associated costs, including training of external affiliates. Repairs and maintenance can also increase the expense of managing an extranet. While start-up costs may be significant, you may experience reductions in other expense areas if you implement an extranet.
