                    Intranet
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The <b>Intranet</b> is a private network accessible only to an organization's staff.
                    In its simplest form, an intranet is established with the technologies for local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs).
                    Many modern intranets have search engines, user profiles, blogs, mobile apps with notifications, and events planning within their infrastructure.
                    
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Origins
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intranets began to appear in a range of larger organizations from 1994.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Uses
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increasingly, intranets are being used to deliver tools, e.g. collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Intranets are also being used as corporate culture-change platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Benefits
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Workforce productivity:</b> Intranets can help users to locate and view information faster and use applications 
                    relevant to their roles and responsibilities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Time:</b> Intranets allow organizations to distribute information to employees on an as-needed basis; 
                    Employees may link to relevant information at their convenience, rather than being distracted indiscriminately by email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Enhance collaboration:</b> Information is easily accessible by all authorised users, which enables teamwork.
                    Being able to communicate in real-time through integrated third party tools, such as an instant messenger, 
                    promotes the sharing of ideas and removes blockages to communication to help boost a business' productivity.
