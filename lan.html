                    The <b>L</b>ocal <b>A</b>rea <b>N</b>etwork is a computer network that interconnects
                    computers within the a limited area such are residence, school, laboratory, university
                    campus or office building.

                <p>
                    The most commonly used technologies for LAN is wifi and ethernet. (Sometimes you will see wifi referred to as "<i>WLAN</i>". This refers to wifi's designation as the <b>W</b>ireless <b>Local</b> <b>A</b>rea <b>N</b>etwork, wireless LAN). However, these are far from the only technologies which has been used with the concept of an LAN. ARCNET was developed by the Datapoint Corporation in 1976 and announced in the subsequent year. Ethernet was developed at Xerox PARC between 1973 and 1974.

                    The first motivations for the development of an LAN is to share storage and printers, both expensive at the time of conception. There was great enthusiasm, but in practice, a wide variety of differing and incompatible hardware and protocols marred its implementation. In 1983, TCP/IP was shown to be effective when it handled the needs of a Defense Department Application. It was also the networking method of choice for Unix Workstations. Although the latter market section was greatly reduced, it has expanded and eventually replaced IPX, AppleTalk, and NBF. It is now prevalent as the standard of choice.

                    Naturally it has some similarities and differences with other internet technologies.
