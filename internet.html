                    The <b>Internet</b> is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite to link devices worldwide

                    Origins
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the federal government of the United States in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication with computer networks.[1] The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s.

                <p>
                     The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.[2] The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet,[3] and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network.

                    Social Impacts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internet usage has grown tremendously. From 2000 to 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion.[81] By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion Google searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube.[82] In 2014 the world's Internet users surpassed 3 billion or 43.6 percent of world population
